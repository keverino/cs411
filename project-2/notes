- print out shifts as well as reduces 
- print out tokens, not direct name such as x instead of t_id 
- identify all the conflicts, work towards resolving each one
- number of conflicts is less important than discussion of how to resolve conflicts
- initalization not supported, thats why void main() {int i =5;} was rejected.
